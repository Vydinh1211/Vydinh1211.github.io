# Giavy Dinh's portforlio

I am used to a student in Graphic design major and I just make a very important decision that I will start again with computer science major, I am very very very new to this major and have zero experience about this major until I study and making this portfolio for very first time. 

# Favorite Lab in CPSC 120L 
* Lab 1 
This Is the most important and very helpful lab because It help me jump in what we call “Coding” how it actually print out and how it really run, honestly I try to print out alot of thing like my name, my age, what am doing with this major. 

* Lab 2 
This is the second lab that I like, like the very first lab it not just help me practice using function to print out and it make me feel like I am “Professional” when I can coding something that I can input my information on it. 

* Lab 6 
This lab make me spend alot of time on it, when we using vector and std::string in it, this part is change the game of mine, while I can not do full part and my best decision is I spend my own money to jump on Coursera to study by myself and from this lab I know codeleet, hackerrank for practice with alot more language, to be honest, I really love the Python from now. Sorry for if this make you guys disappointed about C++.
