# Giavy Dinh's portforlio

I am used to a student in Graphic design major and I just make a very important decision that I will start again with computer science major, I am very very very new to this major and have zero experience about this major until I study and making this portfolio for very first time. 

# Favorite Lab in CPSC 120L 
* Lab 1

    This lab was incredibly important and helpful because it introduced me to the basics of coding, particularly understanding how to use print statements. I enjoyed experimenting with different outputs, such as printing my name, age, and what I hope to achieve with my major. What I liked most about this lab was how it allowed me to interact with code in a simple yet impactful way. The main learning objective I achieved was understanding how to execute a program and see its output, which gave me a foundational grasp of how coding works.

* Lab 2

    The second lab was another favorite of mine because it built on the skills I learned in the first lab. This lab focused on practicing functions to print outputs, and it made me feel confident, almost like a professional, when I could successfully code something that displayed my personal information. What I enjoyed most about this lab was seeing how structured coding can produce dynamic results. The learning objective I realized here was understanding how to write and use functions effectively to produce desired outputs, which deepened my confidence in programming.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was a challenging yet transformative experience. It introduced me to using std::vector and std::string, which felt like a major shift in my understanding of programming. Although I struggled with parts of this lab, I decided to invest in a Coursera course to improve my skills. This lab also motivated me to explore platforms like CodeLeet and HackerRank, where I practiced coding in multiple languages. What I appreciated most about this lab was its complexity, which pushed me to grow as a programmer. The main learning objective I achieved was understanding how to work with dynamic data structures, which has inspired me to learn Python in addition to C++.
